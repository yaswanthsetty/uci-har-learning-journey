# Sensor Data Basics: A Beginner's Guide

## 🤔 What Makes Sensor Data Different?

If you're coming from traditional machine learning datasets (like Titanic, Housing prices, etc.), sensor data might seem confusing at first. Here's why:

### Traditional ML Dataset:
```
| Age | Income | Education | Target |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
| 25  | 50000  | College   | Yes    |
| 35  | 75000  | Masters   | No     |
```
- **Fixed columns** - each feature has a clear meaning
- **One row per sample** - each person is one row
- **Static data** - values don't change over time

### Sensor Dataset:
```
Time: 0.00s -> 0.02s -> 0.04s -> ... -> 2.56s
AccX: 0.1   -> 0.3   -> -0.1  -> ... -> 0.2
AccY: 0.5   -> 0.4   -> 0.6   -> ... -> 0.3
AccZ: 9.8   -> 9.7   -> 9.9   -> ... -> 9.8
```
- **Time-series** - data changes continuously over time
- **Multiple streams** - several sensors recording simultaneously
- **Variable length** - activities can last different amounts of time

## 🎯 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. **Time Windows**
Since activities happen over time, we slice the continuous data into **fixed-size windows**:
- **Window size**: Usually 1-5 seconds of data
- **Overlap**: Windows often overlap by 50% to capture transitions
- **Sampling rate**: How many measurements per second (e.g., 50Hz = 50 per second)

**Example**: 2.56 seconds at 50Hz = 128 data points per window

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
Raw sensor data needs to be transformed into features that ML algorithms can use:

**Raw signal** (128 numbers): `[0.1, 0.3, -0.1, 0.2, ...]`
**Becomes features**: 
- Mean: 0.15
- Standard deviation: 0.18
- Maximum: 0.3
- Energy: 0.05
- etc.

### 3. **Multi-dimensional Data**
Most sensors measure in multiple directions:
- **Accelerometer**: X, Y, Z acceleration
- **Gyroscope**: X, Y, Z rotation
- **Magnetometer**: X, Y, Z magnetic field

Each dimension gets its own set of features!

## 🔧 Common Preprocessing Steps

### 1. **Noise Filtering**
Sensor data is noisy. Common filters:
- **Low-pass filter**: Remove high-frequency noise
- **Median filter**: Remove outliers
- **Smoothing**: Average nearby points

### 2. **Normalization**
Different sensors have different scales:
- **Min-Max scaling**: Scale to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
- **Z-score normalization**: Mean=0, std=1
- **Gravity removal**: For accelerometers, separate gravity from motion

### 3. **Windowing**
Convert continuous streams into discrete samples:
- **Fixed windows**: Same size for all samples
- **Sliding windows**: Overlapping windows for more data
- **Activity-based**: Windows aligned with activity boundaries

## 📊 Types of Features

### **Time Domain Features** (computed directly from signal):
- **Statistical**: mean, std, min, max, median
- **Shape**: skewness, kurtosis, peaks
- **Energy**: RMS, signal magnitude area
- **Temporal**: zero crossings, autocorrelation

### **Frequency Domain Features** (after FFT transform):
- **Spectral power**: Energy at different frequencies
- **Dominant frequency**: Most prominent frequency
- **Spectral entropy**: How spread out the frequencies are
- **Frequency bands**: Energy in specific frequency ranges

### **Derived Features**:
- **Jerk**: Rate of change of acceleration (sudden movements)
- **Magnitude**: Combined X+Y+Z into single value
- **Correlation**: Relationship between different axes
- **Angles**: Orientation relative to gravity

## 🎯 Feature Selection Strategy

### **For Activity Recognition**:
- **Gravity features** → Distinguish upright vs. lying positions
- **Energy features** → Separate active vs. sedentary activities
- **Frequency features** → Identify repetitive movements (walking cycles)

### **For Gesture Recognition**:
- **Jerk features** → Detect sudden movements
- **Peak counting** → Identify repetitive actions
- **Correlation** → Coordination between hand/wrist movements

### **For Health Monitoring**:
- **Regularity measures** → Detect irregular patterns
- **Trend analysis** → Long-term changes
- **Variability** → Stability of movements

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Data Leakage**
- ❌ Don't use future information to predict past events
- ❌ Don't mix data from same person in train/test splits
- ✅ Use proper temporal splits or subject-independent validation

### 2. **Overfitting to Noise**
- ❌ Don't use too many features without proper validation
- ❌ Don't ignore the physical meaning of features
- ✅ Use domain knowledge to select meaningful features

### 3. **Ignoring Sensor Characteristics**
- ❌ Don't assume all sensors are equally reliable
- ❌ Don't ignore sensor placement and orientation
- ✅ Understand what each sensor actually measures
